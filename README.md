## Battleship Project
[Live Game](https://yusef-h.github.io/battleship/) <br>
I built this project by working in a TDD manner to make all the game logic and modules, then I moved on to build the UI while connecting the modules with each other. <br>
# Technologies Used:
Vanilla Javascript, Jest, HTML, CSS. I used webpack for module bundling.
